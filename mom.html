        Life without parents cannot be imagined. They are always very loving and caring. My father is Mr.Naga Raju and my mother is Ms. Rajya Lakshmi. 
    </h3><h3>My father is a businessman . He is a very kind and hardworking person. 
            He loves me dearly and takes care of all my needs. Sometimes he brings beautiful gifts for me, he takes me out, and fills my life with happiness and joy.</h3>
        <h3>My mother stays at home, she’s very caring too-taking care of the house, cooking tasty food for all of us.
